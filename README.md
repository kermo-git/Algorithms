# Algorithms

This is a web application that implements various algorithms that generate interesting visual patterns. The application lets you configure and tweak the parameters of those algorithms, but there isn't much documentation right now.

## Setup

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Clone this repo.
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal (command line).
4. Run `npm install`. This might take a few minutes and it downloads all of the dependencies into `node_modules` folder.

## Run

1. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
2. Run `npm run dev`.
3. Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser

## Description

This application doesn't document itself, but here I will refer to online resources where you can read about the algorithms.
